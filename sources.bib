	abstract = {This paper deals with the problem of long-term wind speed and power forecasting based on meteorological information. Hourly forecasts up to 72-h ahead are produced for a wind park on the Greek island of Crete. As inputs our models use the numerical forecasts of wind speed and direction provided by atmospheric modeling system SKIRON for four nearby positions up to 30 km away from the wind turbine cluster. Three types of local recurrent neural networks are employed as forecasting models, namely, the infinite impulse response multilayer perceptron (IIR-MLP), the local activation feedback multilayer network (LAF-MLN), and the diagonal recurrent neural network (RNN). These networks contain internal feedback paths, with the neuron connections implemented by means of IIR synaptic filters. Two novel and optimal on-line learning schemes are suggested for the update of the recurrent network's weights based on the recursive prediction error algorithm. The methods assure continuous stability of the network during the learning phase and exhibit improved performance compared to the conventional dynamic back propagation. Extensive experimentation is carried out where the three recurrent networks are additionally compared to two static models, a finite-impulse response NN (FIR-NN) and a conventional static-MLP network. Simulation results demonstrate that the recurrent models, trained by the suggested methods, outperform the static ones while they exhibit significant improvement over the persistent method.},

	abstract = {A method for computing optical flow using a neural network is presented. Usually, the measurement primitives used for computing optical flow from successive image frames are the image-intensity values and their spatial and temporal derivatives, and tokens such as edges, corners, and linear features. Conventional methods based on such primitives suffer from edge sparsity, noise distortion, or sensitivity to rotation. The authors first fit a 2-D polynomial to find a smooth continuous image-intensity function in a window and estimate the subpixel intensity values and their principal curvatures. Under the local rigidity assumption and smoothness constraints, a neural network is then used to implement the computing procedure based on the estimated intensity values and their principal curvatures. Owing to the dense measured primitives, a dense optical flow with subpixel accuracy is obtained with only a few iterations. Since intensity values and their principle curvatures are rotation-invariant, this method can detect both rotating and translating objects in the scene. Experimental results using synthetic image sequences demonstrate the efficacy of the method.{\textless}{\textgreater}},

	doi = {10.1109/TIP.2004.836152},
	abstract = {We present an approach that incorporates appearance-adaptive models in a particle filter to realize robust visual tracking and recognition algorithms. Tracking needs modeling interframe motion and appearance changes, whereas recognition needs modeling appearance changes between frames and gallery images. In conventional tracking algorithms, the appearance model is either fixed or rapidly changing, and the motion model is simply a random walk with fixed noise variance. Also, the number of particles is typically fixed. All these factors make the visual tracker unstable. To stabilize the tracker, we propose the following modifications: an observation model arising from an adaptive appearance model, an adaptive velocity motion model with adaptive noise variance, and an adaptive number of particles. The adaptive-velocity model is derived using a first-order linear predictor based on the appearance difference between the incoming observation and the previous particle configuration. Occlusion analysis is implemented using robust statistics. Experimental results on tracking visual objects in long outdoor and indoor video sequences demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our tracking algorithm. We then perform simultaneous tracking and recognition by embedding them in a particle filter. For recognition purposes, we model the appearance changes between frames and gallery images by constructing the intra- and extrapersonal spaces. Accurate recognition is achieved when confronted by pose and view variations.},

	abstract = {Prognostics technique aims to accurately estimate the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of a subsystem or a component using sensor data, which has many real world applications. However, many of the existing algorithms are based on linear models, which cannot capture the complex relationship between the sensor data and RUL. Although Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) has been applied to predict RUL, it cannot learn salient features automatically, because of its network structure. A novel deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based regression approach for estimating the RUL is proposed in this paper. Although CNN has been applied on tasks such as computer vision, natural language processing, speech recognition etc, this is the ﬁrst attempt to adopt CNN for RUL estimation in prognostics. Different from the existing CNN structure for computer vision, the convolution and pooling ﬁlters in our approach are applied along the temporal dimension over the multi-channel sensor data to incorporate automated feature learning from raw sensor signals in a systematic way. Through the deep architecture, the learned features are the higher-level abstract representation of low-level raw sensor signals. Furthermore, feature learning and RUL estimation are mutually enhanced by the supervised feedback. We compared with several state-of-the-art algorithms on two publicly available data sets to evaluate the effectiveness of this proposed approach. The encouraging results demonstrate that our proposed deep convolutional neural network based regression approach for RUL estimation is not only more efﬁcient but also more accurate.},

	abstract = {In many recent object recognition systems, feature extraction stages are generally composed of a ﬁlter bank, a non-linear transformation, and some sort of feature pooling layer. Most systems use only one stage of feature extraction in which the ﬁlters are hard-wired, or two stages where the ﬁlters in one or both stages are learned in supervised or unsupervised mode. This paper addresses three questions: 1. How does the non-linearities that follow the ﬁlter banks inﬂuence the recognition accuracy? 2. does learning the ﬁlter banks in an unsupervised or supervised manner improve the performance over random ﬁlters or hardwired ﬁlters? 3. Is there any advantage to using an architecture with two stages of feature extraction, rather than one? We show that using non-linearities that include rectiﬁcation and local contrast normalization is the single most important ingredient for good accuracy on object recognition benchmarks. We show that two stages of feature extraction yield better accuracy than one. Most surprisingly, we show that a two-stage system with random ﬁlters can yield almost 63\% recognition rate on Caltech-101, provided that the proper non-linearities and pooling layers are used. Finally, we show that with supervised reﬁnement, the system achieves state-of-the-art performance on NORB dataset (5.6\%) and unsupervised pre-training followed by supervised reﬁnement produces good accuracy on Caltech-101 ({\textgreater} 65\%), and the lowest known error rate on the undistorted, unprocessed MNIST dataset (0.53\%).},

	abstract = {Despite the success of neural networks (NNs), there is still a concern among many over their “black box” nature. Why do they work? Yes, we have Universal Approximation Theorems, but these concern statistical consistency, a very weak property, not enough to explain the exceptionally strong performance reports of the method. Here we present a simple analytic argument that NNs are in fact essentially polynomial regression models (PR), with the eﬀective degree of the polynomial growing at each hidden layer. This view will have various implications for NNs, e.g. providing an explanation for why convergence problems arise in NNs, and it gives rough guidance on avoiding overﬁtting. In addition, we use this phenomenon to predict and conﬁrm a multicollinearity property of NNs not previously reported in the literature. Most importantly, this NN ↔ PR correspondence suggests routinely using polynomial models instead of NNs, thus avoiding some major problems of the latter, such as having to set many hyperparameters and deal with convergence issues. We present a number of empirical results; in all cases, the accuracy of the polynomial approach matches, and often exceeds, that of NN approaches. A many-featured, open-source software package, polyreg, is available.},

Unlike many currently available gas turbine handbooks that provide the reader with an overview without in-depth treatment of the subject, the current book is concentrated on a detailed aero-thermodynamics, design and off-deign performance aspects of individual components as well as the system integration and its dynamic operation.This new book provides practicing gas turbine designers and young engineers working in the industry with design material that the manufacturers would keep proprietary. The book is also intended to provide instructors of turbomachinery courses around the world with a powerful tool to assign gas turbine components as project and individual modules that are integrated into a complete system. Quoting many statements by the gas turbine industry professionals, the young engineers graduated from the turbomachinery courses offered by the author, had the competency of engineers equivalent to three to four years of industrial experience.},

The last expansion took place in the summer of 2015 when the archive grew from 45 to 85 data sets. This paper introduces and will focus on the new data expansion from 85 to 128 data sets. Beyond expanding this valuable resource, this paper offers pragmatic advice to anyone who may wish to evaluate a new algorithm on the archive. Finally, this paper makes a novel and yet actionable claim: of the hundreds of papers that show an improvement over the standard baseline (1nearest neighbor classification), a fraction might be mis-attributing the reasons for their improvement. Moreover, the improvements claimed by these papers might have been achievable with a much simpler modification, requiring just a few lines of code.},

These algorithms have been evaluated on subsets of the 47 data sets in the University of California, Riverside time series classiﬁcation archive. The archive has recently been expanded to 85 data sets, over half of which have been donated by researchers at the University of East Anglia. Aspects of previous evaluations have made comparisons between algorithms difﬁcult. For example, several different programming languages have been used, experiments involved a single train/test split and some used normalised data whilst others did not. The relaunch of the archive provides a timely opportunity to thoroughly evaluate algorithms on a larger number of datasets. We have implemented 18 recently proposed algorithms in a common Java framework and compared them against two standard benchmark classiﬁers (and each other) by performing 100 resampling experiments on each of the 85 datasets. We use these results to test several hypotheses relating to whether the algorithms are signiﬁcantly more accurate than the benchmarks and each other. Our results indicate that only nine of these algorithms are signiﬁcantly more accurate than both benchmarks and that one classiﬁer, the collective of transformation ensembles, is signiﬁcantly more accurate than all of the others. All of our experiments and results are reproducible: we release all of our code, results and experimental details and we hope these experiments form the basis for more robust testing of new algorithms in the future.},

These models are used in predictive data analytics applications including price prediction, risk assessment, predicting customer behavior, and document classification. This introductory textbook offers a detailed and focused treatment of the most important machine learning approaches used in predictive data analytics, covering both theoretical concepts and practical applications. Technical and mathematical material is augmented with explanatory worked examples, and case studies illustrate the application of these models in the broader business context.After discussing the trajectory from data to insight to decision, the book describes four approaches to machine learning: information-based learning, similarity-based learning, probability-based learning, and error-based learning. Each of these approaches is introduced by a nontechnical explanation of the underlying concept, followed by mathematical models and algorithms illustrated by detailed worked examples. Finally, the book considers techniques for evaluating prediction models and offers two case studies that describe specific data analytics projects through each phase of development, from formulating the business problem to implementation of the analytics solution. The book, informed by the authors' many years of teaching machine learning, and working on predictive data analytics projects, is suitable for use by undergraduates in computer science, engineering, mathematics, or statistics; by graduate students in disciplines with applications for predictive data analytics; and as a reference for professionals.},

The study encompassed 22,815 women who gave birth between November 1, 1983 and January 31, 1984 in the 30 maternity departments in the country; 2179 deliveries were by emergency cesarean. Multivariate stepwise logistic regression technique indicated that the most important risk factors affecting the decision were the presentation of the fetus and the presence of a uterine scar, followed in descending order by placenta previa or abruptio placentae, maternal disease, primiparity, low birth weight, twins, and advanced maternal age. The mother's ethnic background and type of hospital played an insignificant role in the decision-making process. The specific statistical method applied in this work permits listing the indicators that constitute risk factors for cesarean and provides the net effect of each factor on the decision-making process.

Because the computer gathers knowledge from experience, there is no need for a human computer operator to formally specify all the knowledge that the computer needs. The hierarchy of concepts allows the computer to learn complicated concepts by building them out of simpler ones; a graph of these hierarchies would be many layers deep. This book introduces a broad range of topics in deep learning. The text offers mathematical and conceptual background, covering relevant concepts in linear algebra, probability theory and information theory, numerical computation, and machine learning. It describes deep learning techniques used by practitioners in industry, including deep feedforward networks, regularization, optimization algorithms, convolutional networks, sequence modeling, and practical methodology; and it surveys such applications as natural language processing, speech recognition, computer vision, online recommendation systems, bioinformatics, and videogames. Finally, the book offers research perspectives, covering such theoretical topics as linear factor models, autoencoders, representation learning, structured probabilistic models, Monte Carlo methods, the partition function, approximate inference, and deep generative models. Deep Learning can be used by undergraduate or graduate students planning careers in either industry or research, and by software engineers who want to begin using deep learning in their products or platforms.

We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers---8x deeper than VGG nets but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57\% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28\% relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset. Deep residual nets are foundations of our submissions to ILSVRC \& COCO 2015 competitions, where we also won the 1st places on the tasks of ImageNet detection, ImageNet localization, COCO detection, and COCO segmentation.},

	abstract = {Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) has historically been a driving force behind many machine learning (ML) techniques, including the ubiquitously used hidden Markov model, discriminative learning, structured sequence learning, Bayesian learning, and adaptive learning. Moreover, ML can and occasionally does use ASR as a large-scale, realistic application to rigorously test the effectiveness of a given technique, and to inspire new problems arising from the inherently sequential and dynamic nature of speech. On the other hand, even though ASR is available commercially for some applications, it is largely an unsolved problem - for almost all applications, the performance of ASR is not on par with human performance. New insight from modern ML methodology shows great promise to advance the state-of-the-art in ASR technology. This overview article provides readers with an overview of modern ML techniques as utilized in the current and as relevant to future ASR research and systems. The intent is to foster further cross-pollination between the ML and ASR communities than has occurred in the past. The article is organized according to the major ML paradigms that are either popular already or have potential for making significant contributions to ASR technology. The paradigms presented and elaborated in this overview include: generative and discriminative learning; supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, and active learning; adaptive and multi-task learning; and Bayesian learning. These learning paradigms are motivated and discussed in the context of ASR technology and applications. We finally present and analyze recent developments of deep learning and learning with sparse representations, focusing on their direct relevance to advancing ASR technology.},

	abstract = {Predicting the clinical outcome of patients from the historical electronic health records (EHRs) is a fundamental research area in medical informatics. Although EHRs contain various records associated with each patient, the existing work mainly dealt with the diagnosis codes by employing recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with a simple attention mechanism. This type of sequence modeling often ignores the heterogeneity of EHRs. In other words, it only considers historical diagnoses and does not incorporate patient demographics, which correspond to clinically essential context, into the sequence modeling. To address the issue, we aim at investigating the use of an attention mechanism that is tailored to medical context to predict a future diagnosis. We propose a medical context attention (MCA)-based RNN that is composed of an attention-based RNN and a conditional deep generative model. The novel attention mechanism utilizes the derived individual patient information from conditional variational autoencoders (CVAEs). The CVAE models a conditional distribution of patient embeddings and his/her demographics to provide the measurement of patient's phenotypic difference due to illness. Experimental results showed the effectiveness of the proposed model.},

	abstract = {Objective
The analysis of surgical motion has received a growing interest with the development of devices allowing their automatic capture. In this context, the use of advanced surgical training systems makes an automated assessment of surgical trainee possible. Automatic and quantitative evaluation of surgical skills is a very important step in improving surgical patient care.
Material and method
In this paper, we present an approach for the discovery and ranking of discriminative and interpretable patterns of surgical practice from recordings of surgical motions. A pattern is defined as a series of actions or events in the kinematic data that together are distinctive of a specific gesture or skill level. Our approach is based on the decomposition of continuous kinematic data into a set of overlapping gestures represented by strings (bag of words) for which we compute comparative numerical statistic (tf-idf) enabling the discriminative gesture discovery via its relative occurrence frequency.
Results
We carried out experiments on three surgical motion datasets. The results show that the patterns identified by the proposed method can be used to accurately classify individual gestures, skill levels and surgical interfaces. We also present how the patterns provide a detailed feedback on the trainee skill assessment.
Conclusions
The proposed approach is an interesting addition to existing learning tools for surgery as it provides a way to obtain a feedback on which parts of an exercise have been used to classify the attempt as correct or incorrect.},

	abstract = {Similarity search is the core procedure for several time series mining tasks. While different distance measures can be used for this purpose, there is clear evidence that the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) is the most suitable distance function for a wide range of application domains. Despite its quadratic complexity, research efforts have proposed a significant number of pruning methods to speed up the similarity search under DTW. However, the search may still take a considerable amount of time depending on the parameters of the search, such as the length of the query and the warping window width. The main reason is that the current techniques for speeding up the similarity search focus on avoiding the costly distance calculation between as many pairs of time series as possible. Nevertheless, the few pairs of subsequences that were not discarded by the pruning techniques can represent a significant part of the entire search time. In this work, we adapt a recently proposed algorithm to improve the internal efficiency of the DTW calculation. Our method can speed up the UCR suite, considered the current fastest tool for similarity search under DTW. More important, the longer the time needed for the search, the higher the speedup ratio achieved by our method. We demonstrate that our method performs similarly to UCR suite for small queries and narrow warping constraints. However, it performs up to five times faster for long queries and large warping windows.},

The rotational speed of the shafts reaches as high as 13,000rpm in large engines and even higher in smaller engines as used in helicopters. Hence there is both a concentration of thermal energy in the combustion process and kinetic energy in the rotating parts that presents issues for structural integrity. This paper describes the regulatory requirements that must be achieved to allow operation of engines in civil applications and at how these requirements are satisfied in practice. It concentrates on those parts whose failure can directly threaten the integrity of the airframe through the generation of hazardous effects. The main issues are associated with fatigue through cyclic operation of the engine and the ability of the engine to survive abnormal conditions in such a way that the aircraft can safely land and be brought to rest.},

Their service implementation involves a variety of aspects of which the following are briefly discussed: stress analysis, defects and component life extension methods. Building on several of the concepts discussed, a lifing methodology based on risk regulation of inspection is then introduced. By varying the inspection intervals over time, the number of inspections can be minimized while ensuring that the risk of a failure does not exceed an acceptable level. Given inspection, it is shown that the actual safe service life of a component can be more strongly determined by the probability of crack detection than by the minimum detectable crack size.},

	abstract = {Time series classiﬁcation (TSC) is the area of machine learning interested in learning how to assign labels to time series. The last few decades of work in this area have led to signiﬁcant progress in the accuracy of classiﬁers, with the state of the art now represented by the HIVE-COTE algorithm. While extremely accurate, HIVE-COTE is infeasible to use in many applications because of its very high training time complexity in O(N 2 · T 4) for a dataset with N time series of length T . For example, it takes HIVE-COTE more than 72,000s to learn from a small dataset with N = 700 time series of short length T = 46. Deep learning, on the other hand, has now received enormous attention because of its high scalability and state-of-the-art accuracy in computer vision and natural language processing tasks. Deep learning for TSC has only very recently started to be explored, with the ﬁrst few architectures developed over the last 3 years only. The accuracy of deep learning for TSC has been raised to a competitive level, but has not quite reached the level of HIVE-COTE. This is what this paper achieves: outperforming HIVE-COTE’s accuracy together with scalability. We take an important step towards ﬁnding the AlexNet network for TSC by presenting InceptionTime—an ensemble of deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models, inspired by the Inception-v4 architecture. Our experiments show that InceptionTime slightly outperforms HIVE-COTE with a win/draw/loss on the UCR archive of 40/6/39. Not only is InceptionTime more accurate, but it is much faster: InceptionTime learns from that same dataset with 700 time series in 2,300s but can also learn from a dataset with 8M time series in 13 hours, a quantity of data that is fully out of reach of HIVE-COTE.},

With the increase of time series data availability, hundreds of TSC algorithms have been proposed. Among these methods, only a few have considered Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to perform this task. This is surprising as deep learning has seen very successful applications in the last years. DNNs have indeed revolutionized the field of computer vision especially with the advent of novel deeper architectures such as Residual and Convolutional Neural Networks. Apart from images, sequential data such as text and audio can also be processed with DNNs to reach state-of-the-art performance for document classification and speech recognition. In this article, we study the current state-of-the-art performance of deep learning algorithms for TSC by presenting an empirical study of the most recent DNN architectures for TSC. We give an overview of the most successful deep learning applications in various time series domains under a unified taxonomy of DNNs for TSC. We also provide an open source deep learning framework to the TSC community where we implemented each of the compared approaches and evaluated them on a univariate TSC benchmark (the UCR/UEA archive) and 12 multivariate time series datasets. By training 8730 deep learning models on 97 time series datasets, we propose the most exhaustive study of DNNs for TSC to date.},

	abstract = {Similarity search in large time series databases has attracted much research interest recently. It is a difficult problem because of the typically high dimensionality of the data.. The most promising solutions involve performing dimensionality reduction on the data, then indexing the reduced data with a multidimensional index structure. Many dimensionality reduction techniques have been proposed, including Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), the Discrete Fourier transform (DFT), and the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). In this work we introduce a new dimensionality reduction technique which we call Adaptive Piecewise Constant Approximation (APCA). While previous techniques (e.g., SVD, DFT and DWT) choose a common representation for all the items in the database that minimizes the global reconstruction error, APCA approximates each time series by a set of constant value segments of varying lengths such that their individual reconstruction errors are minimal. We show how APCA can be indexed using a multidimensional index structure. We propose two distance measures in the indexed space that exploit the high fidelity of APCA for fast searching: a lower bounding Euclidean distance approximation, and a non-lower bounding, but very tight Euclidean distance approximation and show how they can support fast exact searching, and even faster approximate searching on the same index structure. We theoretically and empirically compare APCA to all the other techniques and demonstrate its superiority.},
