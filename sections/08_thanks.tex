\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
I would like to express sincere appreciation to my supervisors at Rolls-Royce Deutschland, Dr. Stephan Pannier and Tolga Ya\u{g}c\i{}, M.Sc., who have spent countless hours with me to share their expertise and ideas, and to help me find my place in the world of engineering.

My deepest gratitude is extended to my fianc\'ee, Destina Sevde Ay, for her endless patience and support.
