	abstract = {Time Series Classification (TSC) is an important and challenging problem in data mining. With the increase of time series data availability, hundreds of TSC algorithms have been proposed. Among these methods, only a few have considered Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to perform this task. This is surprising as deep learning has seen very successful applications in the last years. DNNs have indeed revolutionized the field of computer vision especially with the advent of novel deeper architectures such as Residual and Convolutional Neural Networks. Apart from images, sequential data such as text and audio can also be processed with DNNs to reach state-of-the-art performance for document classification and speech recognition. In this article, we study the current state-of-the-art performance of deep learning algorithms for TSC by presenting an empirical study of the most recent DNN architectures for TSC. We give an overview of the most successful deep learning applications in various time series domains under a unified taxonomy of DNNs for TSC. We also provide an open source deep learning framework to the TSC community where we implemented each of the compared approaches and evaluated them on a univariate TSC benchmark (the UCR/UEA archive) and 12 multivariate time series datasets. By training 8730 deep learning models on 97 time series datasets, we propose the most exhaustive study of DNNs for TSC to date.},

	abstract = {Time series classiﬁcation (TSC) is the area of machine learning interested in learning how to assign labels to time series. The last few decades of work in this area have led to signiﬁcant progress in the accuracy of classiﬁers, with the state of the art now represented by the HIVE-COTE algorithm. While extremely accurate, HIVE-COTE is infeasible to use in many applications because of its very high training time complexity in O(N 2 · T 4) for a dataset with N time series of length T . For example, it takes HIVE-COTE more than 72,000s to learn from a small dataset with N = 700 time series of short length T = 46. Deep learning, on the other hand, has now received enormous attention because of its high scalability and state-of-the-art accuracy in computer vision and natural language processing tasks. Deep learning for TSC has only very recently started to be explored, with the ﬁrst few architectures developed over the last 3 years only. The accuracy of deep learning for TSC has been raised to a competitive level, but has not quite reached the level of HIVE-COTE. This is what this paper achieves: outperforming HIVE-COTE’s accuracy together with scalability. We take an important step towards ﬁnding the AlexNet network for TSC by presenting InceptionTime—an ensemble of deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models, inspired by the Inception-v4 architecture. Our experiments show that InceptionTime slightly outperforms HIVE-COTE with a win/draw/loss on the UCR archive of 40/6/39. Not only is InceptionTime more accurate, but it is much faster: InceptionTime learns from that same dataset with 700 time series in 2,300s but can also learn from a dataset with 8M time series in 13 hours, a quantity of data that is fully out of reach of HIVE-COTE.},

Their service implementation involves a variety of aspects of which the following are briefly discussed: stress analysis, defects and component life extension methods. Building on several of the concepts discussed, a lifing methodology based on risk regulation of inspection is then introduced. By varying the inspection intervals over time, the number of inspections can be minimized while ensuring that the risk of a failure does not exceed an acceptable level. Given inspection, it is shown that the actual safe service life of a component can be more strongly determined by the probability of crack detection than by the minimum detectable crack size.},

The rotational speed of the shafts reaches as high as 13,000rpm in large engines and even higher in smaller engines as used in helicopters. Hence there is both a concentration of thermal energy in the combustion process and kinetic energy in the rotating parts that presents issues for structural integrity. This paper describes the regulatory requirements that must be achieved to allow operation of engines in civil applications and at how these requirements are satisfied in practice. It concentrates on those parts whose failure can directly threaten the integrity of the airframe through the generation of hazardous effects. The main issues are associated with fatigue through cyclic operation of the engine and the ability of the engine to survive abnormal conditions in such a way that the aircraft can safely land and be brought to rest.},

	abstract = {Similarity search is the core procedure for several time series mining tasks. While different distance measures can be used for this purpose, there is clear evidence that the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) is the most suitable distance function for a wide range of application domains. Despite its quadratic complexity, research efforts have proposed a significant number of pruning methods to speed up the similarity search under DTW. However, the search may still take a considerable amount of time depending on the parameters of the search, such as the length of the query and the warping window width. The main reason is that the current techniques for speeding up the similarity search focus on avoiding the costly distance calculation between as many pairs of time series as possible. Nevertheless, the few pairs of subsequences that were not discarded by the pruning techniques can represent a significant part of the entire search time. In this work, we adapt a recently proposed algorithm to improve the internal efficiency of the DTW calculation. Our method can speed up the UCR suite, considered the current fastest tool for similarity search under DTW. More important, the longer the time needed for the search, the higher the speedup ratio achieved by our method. We demonstrate that our method performs similarly to UCR suite for small queries and narrow warping constraints. However, it performs up to five times faster for long queries and large warping windows.},

	abstract = {Objective
The analysis of surgical motion has received a growing interest with the development of devices allowing their automatic capture. In this context, the use of advanced surgical training systems makes an automated assessment of surgical trainee possible. Automatic and quantitative evaluation of surgical skills is a very important step in improving surgical patient care.
Material and method
In this paper, we present an approach for the discovery and ranking of discriminative and interpretable patterns of surgical practice from recordings of surgical motions. A pattern is defined as a series of actions or events in the kinematic data that together are distinctive of a specific gesture or skill level. Our approach is based on the decomposition of continuous kinematic data into a set of overlapping gestures represented by strings (bag of words) for which we compute comparative numerical statistic (tf-idf) enabling the discriminative gesture discovery via its relative occurrence frequency.
Results
We carried out experiments on three surgical motion datasets. The results show that the patterns identified by the proposed method can be used to accurately classify individual gestures, skill levels and surgical interfaces. We also present how the patterns provide a detailed feedback on the trainee skill assessment.
Conclusions
The proposed approach is an interesting addition to existing learning tools for surgery as it provides a way to obtain a feedback on which parts of an exercise have been used to classify the attempt as correct or incorrect.},

	abstract = {Predicting the clinical outcome of patients from the historical electronic health records (EHRs) is a fundamental research area in medical informatics. Although EHRs contain various records associated with each patient, the existing work mainly dealt with the diagnosis codes by employing recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with a simple attention mechanism. This type of sequence modeling often ignores the heterogeneity of EHRs. In other words, it only considers historical diagnoses and does not incorporate patient demographics, which correspond to clinically essential context, into the sequence modeling. To address the issue, we aim at investigating the use of an attention mechanism that is tailored to medical context to predict a future diagnosis. We propose a medical context attention (MCA)-based RNN that is composed of an attention-based RNN and a conditional deep generative model. The novel attention mechanism utilizes the derived individual patient information from conditional variational autoencoders (CVAEs). The CVAE models a conditional distribution of patient embeddings and his/her demographics to provide the measurement of patient's phenotypic difference due to illness. Experimental results showed the effectiveness of the proposed model.},

	abstract = {Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) has historically been a driving force behind many machine learning (ML) techniques, including the ubiquitously used hidden Markov model, discriminative learning, structured sequence learning, Bayesian learning, and adaptive learning. Moreover, ML can and occasionally does use ASR as a large-scale, realistic application to rigorously test the effectiveness of a given technique, and to inspire new problems arising from the inherently sequential and dynamic nature of speech. On the other hand, even though ASR is available commercially for some applications, it is largely an unsolved problem - for almost all applications, the performance of ASR is not on par with human performance. New insight from modern ML methodology shows great promise to advance the state-of-the-art in ASR technology. This overview article provides readers with an overview of modern ML techniques as utilized in the current and as relevant to future ASR research and systems. The intent is to foster further cross-pollination between the ML and ASR communities than has occurred in the past. The article is organized according to the major ML paradigms that are either popular already or have potential for making significant contributions to ASR technology. The paradigms presented and elaborated in this overview include: generative and discriminative learning; supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, and active learning; adaptive and multi-task learning; and Bayesian learning. These learning paradigms are motivated and discussed in the context of ASR technology and applications.

	abstract = {Deeper neural networks are more difficult to train. We present a residual learning framework to ease the training of networks that are substantially deeper than those used previously. We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers---8x deeper than VGG nets but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57\% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28\% relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset. Deep residual nets are foundations of our submissions to ILSVRC \& COCO 2015 competitions, where we also won the 1st places on the tasks of ImageNet detection, ImageNet localization, COCO detection, and COCO segmentation.},

Because the computer gathers knowledge from experience, there is no need for a human computer operator to formally specify all the knowledge that the computer needs. The hierarchy of concepts allows the computer to learn complicated concepts by building them out of simpler ones; a graph of these hierarchies would be many layers deep. This book introduces a broad range of topics in deep learning. The text offers mathematical and conceptual background, covering relevant concepts in linear algebra, probability theory and information theory, numerical computation, and machine learning. It describes deep learning techniques used by practitioners in industry, including deep feedforward networks, regularization, optimization algorithms, convolutional networks, sequence modeling, and practical methodology; and it surveys such applications as natural language processing, speech recognition, computer vision, online recommendation systems, bioinformatics, and videogames.

	abstract = {The risk factors that influenced the decision to perform cesarean were ranked in a nationwide census of deliveries conducted in Israel. The study encompassed 22,815 women who gave birth between November 1, 1983 and January 31, 1984 in the 30 maternity departments in the country; 2179 deliveries were by emergency cesarean. Multivariate stepwise logistic regression technique indicated that the most important risk factors affecting the decision were the presentation of the fetus and the presence of a uterine scar, followed in descending order by placenta previa or abruptio placentae, maternal disease, primiparity, low birth weight, twins, and advanced maternal age. The mother's ethnic background and type of hospital played an insignificant role in the decision-making process. The specific statistical method applied in this work permits listing the indicators that constitute risk factors for cesarean and provides the net effect of each factor on the decision-making process.

	abstract = {A comprehensive introduction to the most important machine learning approaches used in predictive data analytics, covering both theoretical concepts and practical applications.Machine learning is often used to build predictive models by extracting patterns from large datasets. These models are used in predictive data analytics applications including price prediction, risk assessment, predicting customer behavior, and document classification. This introductory textbook offers a detailed and focused treatment of the most important machine learning approaches used in predictive data analytics, covering both theoretical concepts and practical applications. Technical and mathematical material is augmented with explanatory worked examples, and case studies illustrate the application of these models in the broader business context.After discussing the trajectory from data to insight to decision, the book describes four approaches to machine learning: information-based learning, similarity-based learning, probability-based learning, and error-based learning. Each of these approaches is introduced by a nontechnical explanation of the underlying concept, followed by mathematical models and algorithms illustrated by detailed worked examples. Finally, the book considers techniques for evaluating prediction models and offers two case studies that describe specific data analytics projects through each phase of development, from formulating the business problem to implementation of the analytics solution. The book, informed by the authors' many years of teaching machine learning, and working on predictive data analytics projects, is suitable for use by undergraduates in computer science, engineering, mathematics, or statistics; by graduate students in disciplines with applications for predictive data analytics; and as a reference for professionals.},

We hope their insights will inspire new research efforts, and give young researchers (including PhD students) a high-level guideline as to where the hot problems are located in data mining.
            Due to the limited amount of time, we were only able to send out our survey requests to the organizers of the IEEE ICDM and ACM KDD conferences, and we received an overwhelming response. We are very grateful for the contributions provided by these researchers despite their busy schedules. This short article serves to summarize the 10 most challenging problems of the 14 responses we have received from this survey. The order of the listing does not reflect their level of importance.},

	abstract = {In the last 5 years there have been a large number of new time series classiﬁcation algorithms proposed in the literature. These algorithms have been evaluated on subsets of the 47 data sets in the University of California, Riverside time series classiﬁcation archive. The archive has recently been expanded to 85 data sets, over half of which have been donated by researchers at the University of East Anglia. Aspects of previous evaluations have made comparisons between algorithms difﬁcult. For example, several different programming languages have been used, experiments involved a single train/test split and some used normalised data whilst others did not. The relaunch of the archive provides a timely opportunity to thoroughly evaluate algorithms on a larger number of datasets. We have implemented 18 recently proposed algorithms in a common Java framework and compared them against two standard benchmark classiﬁers (and each other) by performing 100 resampling experiments on each of the 85 datasets. We use these results to test several hypotheses relating to whether the algorithms are signiﬁcantly more accurate than the benchmarks and each other. Our results indicate that only nine of these algorithms are signiﬁcantly more accurate than both benchmarks and that one classiﬁer, the collective of transformation ensembles, is signiﬁcantly more accurate than all of the others. All of our experiments and results are reproducible: we release all of our code, results and experimental details and we hope these experiments form the basis for more robust testing of new algorithms in the future.},

	abstract = {The UCR time series archive - introduced in 2002, has become an important resource in the time series data mining community, with at least one thousand published papers making use of at least one data set from the archive. The original incarnation of the archive had sixteen data sets but since that time, it has gone through periodic expansions. The last expansion took place in the summer of 2015 when the archive grew from 45 to 85 data sets. This paper introduces and will focus on the new data expansion from 85 to 128 data sets. Beyond expanding this valuable resource, this paper offers pragmatic advice to anyone who may wish to evaluate a new algorithm on the archive. Finally, this paper makes a novel and yet actionable claim: of the hundreds of papers that show an improvement over the standard baseline (1nearest neighbor classification), a fraction might be mis-attributing the reasons for their improvement. Moreover, the improvements claimed by these papers might have been achievable with a much simpler modification, requiring just a few lines of code.},
